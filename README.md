# The Arcane Algorithm Archive

This is a repo that holds the website materials for the algorithm archive: https://algorithm-archivists.github.io/.
Unfortunately, the only way to build this is by `cp`'ing the `_book/` directory
from a built version of the algorithm archive repository: https://github.com/algorithm-archivists/algorithm-archive
